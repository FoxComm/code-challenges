# Introduction

Welcome to your Github coding test!

We know you've already spent plenty of your personal time during
interviews. Worry not; this is the last step of our process and it is
designed to be relatively quick. We appreciate both your time and patience!

We've hand-crafted a coding challenge in Ruby and in our problem domain, for your intellect to
chew on. We've designed the challenge to test your problem solving skills in addition to your communication skills.
Please, take the time to read through this entire readme.  

Good luck!

## Problem

Create a test-driven [vending machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vending_machine) in Ruby.  
The vending machine can take any currency you wish, and can sell any products you wish.  
The vending machine should be API driven and respond to basic commands, such as `pay` and `select_products` 

Your primary objectives:

1. Write tests that describe the basic functionality, in your eyes, of a vending machine.
2. Represent a basic data model that underpins the functionality.
3. Do NOT use rails.  Instead, use Ruby and any gems you choose (aside from the rails gem).
4. Create at least one working API endpoint.

Things you don't need:

1. Persistence.
2. All endpoints to be fully working.
3. Full implementation of business logic.
4. A user interface.

## What we are looking for

* Thoughtfulness.
* Simplicity and speed.
* How do you communicate and incorporate feedback.
* Great test coverage.

## Some guidelines to help you get started

As you will notice, this is not a simple algorithms or computer science test.  We are trying to get an idea for how you think and how you communicate as a teammate.  
  
Please commit your work to branches in this repo and send us Pull Requests early. You can mark them as 'wip' until they are 'ready for review.'  We will follow along as you add more commits, commenting and collaborating with you.

Some things you might want to consider doing to help us along:

* Open pull-requests early.  
* Document your thinking (either in a PR or an Issue)
  * Why did you choose the frameworks and libraries you did?
  * What functionality did you choose to focus on?  To omit?  Why?
  * What were your design/archetecture considerations?
* Open issues with any questions you have.
  * What isn't clear to you?
  * Which assumptions are you making because of lacking information?
  * Don't feel obligated to wait for answers.  Feel free to make assumptions and proceed.


## Time Limitations

There are no strict time limitations on this code challenge.  We generally asks that people submit for final review within 5 days from starting.  This helps us ensure that the challenge doesn't get stale or lost in among our various priorities. 

**When you feel as though your work is complete, please let us know via a final pull-request or opening an issue.**
