# Introduction

Welcome to your Github coding test!

We know you've already spent plenty of your personal time during
interviews. Worry not; this is the last step of our process and it is
designed to be relatively quick. We appreciate both your time and patience!

We've hand-crafted a coding challenge in our problem domain, for your intellect to
chew on. We've designed the challenge to test your problem solving skills in addition to your communication skills.
Please, take the time to read through this entire readme.  

Good luck!

## Problem

Create a test-driven [vending machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vending_machine) in the language of your choice.  
The vending machine can take any currency you wish, and can sell any products you wish.  
The vending machine should be API driven and respond to basic commands, such as `pay` and `select_products` 

Your primary objectives:

1. Write tests that describe the basic functionality, in your eyes, of a vending machine.
2. Represent a basic data model that underlays the functionality.
3. Choose whatever language you wish.  Some options you might consider: Ruby, GoLang, Python, Scala, Erlang, Haskell, and Clojure.
3. Do NOT use a full-stack framework such as rails or django.  You can use specific components of frameworks, however.  (Ex: ActiveRecord)
4. Create at least one working API endpoint.

Things you don't need:

1. Persistence.
2. All endpoints to be fully working.
3. Full implementation of business logic.


Please commit your work to branches in this repo and send us Pull Requests early. You can mark them as 'wip' until they are 'ready for review.'
We will follow along as you add more commits, commenting and collaborating with you. You have as much or as little time as you want. If you are not sure how to best do this you can open an issue on the repository to discuss the design and test strategy.

## What we are looking for

* Tests to verify correctness.
* Small commits.
* Simplicity: how did tests drive your design and help you arrive at the simplest solution both for the API and implementation.
* How does git and github factor into your development process.
* How do you communicate with the team and incorporate feedback.
