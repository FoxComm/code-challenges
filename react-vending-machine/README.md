# Introduction

Welcome to your Github coding challenge!

Thank you for the time you've spent with us during the interview process. This is the last step of our process and it is
designed to be relatively quick. We appreciate both your time and patience!

We've hand-crafted a coding challenge in our problem domain and using some of our favorite technologies for your intellect to
chew on. We've designed the challenge to test your problem solving skills in addition to your communication skills.
Please, take the time to read through this entire readme.  

Good luck!

## Problem

Create a [vending machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vending_machine) using react.js and any other technologies you wish.  
The vending machine can take any currency you wish, and can sell any products you wish.  
The vending machine should be API driven and respond to basic commands, such as `pay` and `select_products` 

Your primary objectives:

1. Represent a basic data model that underlays the functionality.
2. Prototype (quickly) a simple UI that allows the user to interact with the machine.
3. Create at least one action in the UI that behaves the way the user would expect. 

Things you don't need:

1. An API Backend.  (Feel free to mock-data in the UI.)
2. Persistence.  (You can  persist in-memory for now.)
3. Full implementation of the machine.  (One or two actions is enough.)
4. Unit tests.  (Really. We won't judge you.)


Please commit your work to branches in this repo and send us Pull Requests early. You can mark them as 'wip' until they are 'ready for review.'
We will follow along as you add more commits, commenting and collaborating with you. You have as much or as little time as you want. If you are not sure how to best do this you can open an issue on the repository to discuss the design and architecture.

## What we are looking for

* Thoughtfulness.
* Simplicity and speed.
* How do you communicate and incorporate feedback.

## Some guidelines to help you get started

As you will notice, this is not a simple algorithms or computer science test.  We are trying to get an idea for how you think and how you communicate as a teammate.  
  
Some things you might want to consider doing to help us along:

* Open pull-requests early.  
* Document your thinking (either in a PR or an Issue)
  * Why did you choose the frameworks and libraries you did?
  * What functionality did you choose to focus on?  To omit?  Why?
  * What were your design/archetecture considerations?
* Open issues with any questions you have.
  * What isn't clear to you?
  * Which assumptions are you making because of lacking information?
  * Don't feel obligated to wait for answers.  Feel free to make assumptions and proceed.
