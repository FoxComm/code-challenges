# Introduction

Welcome to your Github coding test!

Thank you for the time you've spent with us during the interview process. This is the last step of our process and it is
designed to be relatively quick. We appreciate both your time and patience!

We've hand-crafted a coding challenge in our problem domain and using some of our favorite technologies for your intellect to
chew on. We've designed the challenge to test your problem solving skills in addition to your communication skills.
Please, take the time to read through this entire readme.  

Good luck!

## Problem

Create a test-driven [vending machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vending_machine) using react.js and any other technologies you wish.  
The vending machine can take any currency you wish, and can sell any products you wish.  
The vending machine should be API driven and respond to basic commands, such as `pay` and `select_products` 

Your primary objectives:

1. Represent a basic data model that underlays the functionality.
2. Prototype (quickly) a simple UI that allows the user to interact with the machine.
3. Create at least one action in the UI that behaves the way the user would expect. 

Things you don't need:

1. An API Backend.  (Feel free to mock-data in the UI.)
2. Persistence.  (You can  persist in-memory for now.)
3. Full implementation of the machine.  (One or two actions is enough.)
4. Unit tests.  (Really. We won't judge you.)


Please commit your work to branches in this repo and send us Pull Requests early. You can mark them as 'wip' until they are 'ready for review.'
We will follow along as you add more commits, commenting and collaborating with you. You have as much or as little time as you want. If you are not sure how to best do this you can open an issue on the repository to discuss the design and test strategy.

## What we are looking for

* Thoughtfulness.
* Simplicity and speed.
* How do you communicate and incorporate feedback.
