# Introduction

Welcome to your Github coding challenge!

Thank you for the time you've spent with us during the interview process. This is the last step of our process and it is
designed to be relatively quick. We appreciate both your time and patience!

We've hand-crafted a coding challenge in our problem domain and using some of our favorite technologies for your intellect to
chew on. We've designed the challenge to test your problem solving skills in addition to your communication skills.
Please, take the time to read through this entire readme.  

Good luck!

## Problem

Imagine that you have taken over a project that has very little documentation or context because the previous developer left the company.

Your boss has given you the table component contained in this repository and asked you to make some key notable improvements to it:

1. Implement the ability to add new rows to this table.  
2. Implement highlighting for newly-added rows in table if `detectNewRows` property is set to `true`.
3. Allow the user to select one or more rows via a checkbox, such that they can take some action against multiple rows.  
  1. Implement selecting rows via checkboxes in each data row.
  2. Implement selecting/deselecting all rows via checkbox in the header row
  3. Head checkbox should have three states - all rows are selected, none of rows are selected and some of rows are selected.

Please commit your work to branches in this repo and send us Pull Requests early. You can mark them as 'wip' until they are 'ready for review.'
We will follow along as you add more commits, commenting and collaborating with you. You have as much or as little time as you want. If you are not sure how to best do this you can open an issue on the repository to discuss the design and architecture.

### Bonus Opportunities (Optional)

1. Your boss mentions that the table has no styles currently.  She asks you to do some quick styling in advance of the demo to ensure it impresses the client.  Use your best judgment on aesthetics.

## What we are looking for

* Thoughtfulness.
* Simplicity and speed.
* How do you communicate and incorporate feedback.

## Some guidelines to help you get started

As you will notice, this is not a simple algorithms or computer science test.  We are trying to get an idea for how you think and how you communicate as a teammate.  
  
Some things you might want to consider doing to help us along:

* Open pull-requests early.  
* Document your thinking (either in a PR or an Issue)
  * Why did you make the technology choices you did?
  * What functionality did you choose to focus on?  To omit?  Why?
  * What were your design/archetecture considerations?
* Open issues with any questions you have.
  * What isn't clear to you?
  * Which assumptions are you making because of lacking information?
  * Don't feel obligated to wait for answers.  Feel free to make assumptions and proceed.
