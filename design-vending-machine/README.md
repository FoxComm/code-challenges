# Introduction

Welcome to your Github technical challenge!

We know you've already spent plenty of your personal time during
interviews. Worry not; this is the last step of our process and it is
designed to be relatively quick. We appreciate both your time and patience!

We've hand-crafted a challenge that evaluates your problem solving skills in addition to your communication skills.
Please, take the time to read through this entire readme.  

Good luck!

## Problem

You are planning to create a [vending machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vending_machine) for a future project.  In this project, you will have full control over the technology choices and we will be able to implement it in the language of your choice.  
The vending machine can take any currency you wish, and can sell any products you wish.  
The vending machine will be API-driven, and multiple UIs can be built separately to consume it.  The vending machine should respond to basic commands, such as `pay` and `select_products` 

This excercise *does not require you to build the vending machine, but only to design it and plan it.*  Your primary objectives for this excercise are as follows:

1. Create a basic data model that would power the vending machine.  
2. Outline your future API endpoint.  
3. Tell us what technology choices you would make: what language would you choose to use?  What frameworks or libraries would you use?  
4. Create a mini-roadmap: what features would you work on and in what order?  

Please use whatever tools you wish to convey your ideas most clearly to us.  There are no specific formats or requirements for how the data model and API endpoints are presented to us.  When you feel that your work is ready for review, please create a pull-request and mark it as 'ready for review.'

## What we are looking for

* Thoughtfulness.
* Clear explanation of ideas.
* How do you communicate and incorporate feedback.

## Some guidelines to help you get started

As you will notice, this is not a simple algorithms or computer science test.  We are trying to get an idea for how you think and how you communicate as a teammate.  
  
Some things you might want to consider doing to help us along:

* Open pull-requests early.  
* Document your thinking (either in a PR or an Issue)
  * Why did you choose the frameworks and libraries you did?
  * What functionality did you choose to focus on?  To omit?  Why?
  * What were your design/archetecture considerations?
* Open issues with any questions you have.
  * What isn't clear to you?
  * Which assumptions are you making because of lacking information?
  * Don't feel obligated to wait for answers.  Feel free to make assumptions and proceed.
